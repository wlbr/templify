# templify
A tool to be used with 'go generate' to embed external template files into Go code.

## Scenario
An often used scenario in developing go applications is to generate text (e.g. html pages) 
using the Go template packages. You have two choices: either editing the template in a
dedicated file and to read this file at runtime from your application. Or you add a 
"big" string containing the template to the source of your app and parse this string to 
create the template.

If you want to create a single file application, then the more handy solution with a 
dedicated file is not desirable. On the other hand to edit a complex html template within 
a Go string in the source is very uncomfortable. 

templify allows you to edit your template in an extra file and to generate an Go source
file containing the embedded string.

## Installation
   `go get github.com/wlbr/templify`

## Usage
Simply add a line 

   `//go:generate templify mytemplate.file`

for each template you want to embed. Every time you run a `go generate` in the 
corresponding folder, the file `mytemplate.go` will be created. It contains a 
function `mytemplateTemplate` returning the template string.

You may use `templify mytemplate.file` directly on the command line.

## Switches
Usage of templify: `templify [switches] templatefilename`<br>
   -e	<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export the generated, the template returning function. Default (false) means the function will not be exported.
  
   -f <br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no formatting of the generated source. Default false means source will be formatted with gofmt.
  
   -n string<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    	name of generated, the template returning function. Its name will have 'Template' attached. Will be set to $(basename -s .ext outputfile) if empty (default).
      
   -o string<br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of output file. Defaults to name of template file excluding extension + '.go'.
  
   -p string<br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of package to be used in generated code (default "main").
    	
   -t string<br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of alternate code generation template file. If empty (default), then the embedded template will be used. Template variables supplied are: .Name, .Package, .Content
